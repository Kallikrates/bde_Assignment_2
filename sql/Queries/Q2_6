-- Notes: Creating a view to store active listings and then using this to calculate changes in these listings. As, to arrange this
-- in a single view neighbourhood_cleansed and year_month has been combined, it must be noted that the 'Running_Diff_Per' runs sequentially
-- down the page, an thus when it changes between neighbourhood_cleansed, it will still provide a change, which is not relevant for 
-- this view. This should be ignored.
