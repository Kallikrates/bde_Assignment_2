-- Notes: Creating a cte to store inactive listings and then using this to calculate changes in these listings. 
-- As there are not many inactive listings, a few issues of useability need to be addressed. If this calculation is month by month,
-- firstly, there will be a problem as numbers cannot be divided by zero. However, when this happens, the change can be made 0,
-- to reflect no change from 0 to 0. However, as the question asks for a 'Percentage change for inactive listings', this change
-- trend is captured by filtering to only show records where inactive_listings > 0, assuming all other dates are 0. This is a more
-- useful view, and thus the one adopted here. Also, as with materialized view Question_2_6_percentage_change_for_active_listings, 
-- it must be noted that the 'Running_Diff_Per' runs sequentially down the page, an thus when it changes between neighbourhood_cleansed, 
-- it will still provide a change, which is not relevant for this view. This should be ignored.
